Your friend Phil came up with a great new Bitcoin investment strategy, but before he can start making millions, he needs to know the minimum, average and maximum exchange rate for certain periods in the last few months.

He'll pay you 0.5 Bitcoin for a function that takes several arrays (one for each period) and calculates the minimum, average and maximum for each array, as well as the total minimum, average and maximum. Some numbers at the start and end of each period don't agree with Phil's theory, so he wants you to discard them.
