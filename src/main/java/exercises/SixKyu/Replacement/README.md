Little Petya very much likes sequences. However, recently he received a sequence as a gift from his mother.
 Petya didn't like it at all! He decided to make a single replacement. After this replacement, Petya would like to the sequence in increasing order.
 He asks himself: What is the lowest possible value I could have got after making the replacement and sorting the sequence?
