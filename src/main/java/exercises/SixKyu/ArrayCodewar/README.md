Two kingdoms are at war and, thanks to your codewarrior prowesses, you have been named general by one of the warring states. Your opponent's armies are larger than yours, but maybe you can reach a stalemate or even win the conflict if you are a good strategist.

You control the same number of armies as the rival state, but theirs are generally larger. You have to send a single army to fight each of your opponent's ones.
(It implies there will be as many battles as armies).
There are no possible David-and-Goliath surprises : the outcome of a battle is always the victory of the larger army (or a standoff if both are of the same size).
The winning side is the one which wins the most battles.
The outcome can be a stalemate if both win the same number.
